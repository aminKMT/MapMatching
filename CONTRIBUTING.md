# Contributing to MapMatching Repository

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We Use Github Flow

We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Check out this great bug report guide from StackOverflow. Following these guidelines helps maintainers (and the community) to understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.
Use a Consistent Coding Style

    2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
    You can try running npm run lint for style unification
